# QTM 350 - Quiz 03

## AI-Assisted Programming, Local LLMs, and Cloud Computing

In this quiz, you will need to complete two activities. The first involves creating a custom language model using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). The second involves simple data analysis in Python using [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Both tasks relate to content covered in lectures 11, 13, 14, and 15.

As we have done in previous quizzes, answers must be in a fork of the quiz repository, whose link you should submit on Canvas.

**Screenshots will not be accepted.** Files and directories uploaded via the GitHub website (without using the terminal) will have points deducted.

## Activity 1: Creating a Custom Language Model with Ollama

In this first part of the quiz, you will create a chatbot called `sarcastic` that responds to user questions with sarcasm. The chatbot should be:

- Extremely sarcastic
- Subtly rude
- Reluctantly helpful
- Use sophisticated vocabulary and grammar
- Not overly verbose
- Capable of handling a wide range of topics
- Able to recognise and respond to sarcasm in user input

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Create a directory called `ollama`. Inside the `ollama` directory, create a file called `Modelfile` and another called `ollama.md`
3. Install a base Ollama model. You may use any base model, but `gemma3`, `deepseek-r1` and `llama3.2` are recommended. **Pay attention to model sizes and choose a version suitable for your computer**. Use the smallest version available if in doubt. See available models at <https://ollama.com/models>
4. Create a Modelfile containing:
   - `FROM` statement
   - `PARAMETER` (at minimum `temperature`)
   - A detailed `SYSTEM` prompt describing the chatbot's personality and behaviour
5. Create the chatbot using the `Modelfile`
6. Test the chatbot using `ollama run sarcastic`. Verify it handles various topics with appropriate sarcasm
7. In `ollama.md`, document:
   - Commands used in the process
   - Two example prompts with the model's responses
8. Add, commit, and push your changes to your forked repository

## Activity 2: Data Analysis with Python on AWS EC2

In this second part, you will use AWS EC2 to perform simple Python data analysis. The script `weather_analysis.py`  analyses `weather_data.txt` (a fictional city's weather dataset). Both are available in the `aws` directory of this repository. The script:

- Calculates basic statistics
- Creates a visualisation showing temperature ranges and precipitation over time
- Saves the plot as `weather_analysis.png`

1. Log into your AWS account and create an EC2 instance with:
   - Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
   - SSD Volume Type
   - t2.micro instance type (free tier eligible)
2. Create an SSH key pair (`.pem`) or use an existing one. Ensure the key pair has the correct permissions with `chmod`
3. Configure security groups to allow SSH access
4. Allocate at least 10GB disk space (but less than 30GB) for the instance
5. Connect to the instance using `ssh -i <key.pem> ubuntu@<public-ip>`
6. Update and upgrade system packages with `apt`
7. Install required packages: `python3` `python3-pandas`, `python3-matplotlib`, `python3-numpy`, and `python3-seaborn`
8. From your local terminal, upload the files `weather_data.py` and `weather_data.txt` to the EC2 instance using `scp -i <key.pem> <file> ubuntu@<public-ip>:~` (note that the `:~` specifies the home directory of your instance)
9. Run the script `weather_analysis.py` on the EC2 instance using Python
10. Run the command `cat /etc/os-release > os.txt` on the instance
11. From your local terminal, download the `os.txt` and `weather_analysis.png` files to the `aws` directory on your machine (note the syntax: `scp -i <key.pem> <source> <destination>`)
12. **Terminate the EC2 instance** to avoid charges and **do not include the .pem file in your repository**. The `.pem` file is sensitive and should never be shared publicly
13. Add, commit, and push your changes
14. Submit your repository link on Canvas

**Good luck!** 😃
